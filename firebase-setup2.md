# Firestore Database Setup Guide

## üö® CRITICAL: Enable Firestore Database

The errors you're seeing indicate that **Firestore Database is NOT created** in your Firebase project.

```
WebChannelConnection RPC 'Listen' stream transport errored
Failed to get document because the client is offline
```

These errors mean Firestore cannot connect because the database doesn't exist.

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Enable Firestore

### 1. Open Firebase Console
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Select your project: **"saheli1"**

### 2. Create Firestore Database
1. In the left sidebar, click on **"Firestore Database"**
2. Click the **"Create database"** button
3. You'll see two options:

#### Option A: Start in Production Mode (Recommended for Production)
- Select **"Start in production mode"**
- Click **"Next"**
- Choose a location (select closest to your users, e.g., `asia-south1` for India)
- Click **"Enable"**

#### Option B: Start in Test Mode (Good for Development)
- Select **"Start in test mode"** (allows read/write for 30 days)
- Click **"Next"**
- Choose a location (e.g., `asia-south1`)
- Click **"Enable"**

**Note**: Test mode is easier for development but less secure. You can change security rules later.

### 3. Wait for Database Creation
- Firebase will create the database (takes ~30 seconds)
- You'll see "Cloud Firestore" screen with the "Data", "Rules", "Indexes", "Usage" tabs

### 4. Set Up Security Rules (If you chose Production Mode)

Click on the **"Rules"** tab and replace with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow users to read and write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

Click **"Publish"** to save the rules.

## ‚úÖ Verification

After creating the Firestore database:

1. **Restart your React Native app completely**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current app
   # Then restart:
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs** - You should see:
   ```
   Firestore initialized for React Native with offline support
   ```

3. **Test Registration**:
   - Register a new user
   - Fill in user details
   - Data should now save successfully

4. **Verify Data in Firebase Console**:
   - Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Data tab
   - You should see a `users` collection
   - Click on it to see user documents

## üîß Updated Configuration

The following improvements have been made to your app:

### ‚úÖ Firestore Configuration
- **Offline persistence** enabled for React Native
- **Long polling** enabled for better mobile connectivity
- **Unlimited cache** for better offline experience
- **Better error handling** with helpful messages

### ‚úÖ Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when Firestore is unavailable
- Specific error messages for connection issues
- App won't crash if Firestore is temporarily offline

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Transport Errors?

**1. Verify Firestore is Created:**
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Check if "Firestore Database" section shows data
   - If it says "Get started", you haven't created the database yet

**2. Check Internet Connection:**
   - Ensure your device/emulator has internet access
   - Try opening a website to verify connectivity

**3. Clear App Cache:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

**4. Check Security Rules:**
   - If using Production mode, ensure security rules allow authenticated users
   - Test mode allows all access for 30 days (easier for development)

**5. Restart Metro Bundler:**
   - Stop the app completely (Ctrl+C)
   - Clear cache: `npx expo start --clear`
   - Restart on Android: `npx expo start --android`

### Permission Denied Error?

If you get "permission-denied" errors:

1. Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
2. For **testing**, you can temporarily use (NOT for production):
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Click "Publish"

## üéâ Success Indicators

When Firestore is properly configured, you'll see:

### In Console Logs:
```
‚úÖ Firebase app initialized successfully
‚úÖ Firebase Auth initialized for React Native with AsyncStorage
‚úÖ Firestore initialized for React Native with offline support
‚úÖ User details saved successfully
‚úÖ User details retrieved successfully
```

### In Firebase Console:
- `users` collection appears
- User documents with their data
- Timestamps showing recent writes

### In Your App:
- ‚úÖ Users can register
- ‚úÖ User details save successfully
- ‚úÖ Profile screen shows user data
- ‚úÖ No transport error warnings
- ‚úÖ App works offline (cached data)

## üîí Security Best Practices

### For Production:

1. **Use Production Mode** with strict security rules
2. **Validate data** on client and server side
3. **Use security rules** to restrict access:
   ```javascript
   // Only allow users to access their own data
   match /users/{userId} {
     allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
   }
   ```

### For Development:

1. **Test Mode** is fine (30-day limit)
2. Remember to **update rules before launch**
3. Monitor usage in Firebase Console

## üìû Need More Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Usage tab (ensure you're within quota)
2. Verify your Firebase project is active (not suspended)
3. Check if you're on the Spark (free) or Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan
4. Ensure your app's package name matches Firebase project configuration
