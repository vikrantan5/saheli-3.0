## 🔐 Security

### Firestore Security Rules
Updated rules located in `/app/FIRESTORE_RULES.md`

Key security features:
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin vs user)
- ✅ Users can only access their own carts and orders
- ✅ Only admins can create, update, or delete products
- ✅ Admins can view all orders and update delivery status
- ✅ Users cannot change their own role to admin

### Admin Setup
To create an admin account:

1. Register a new account with email: `admin@saheli.com`
2. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
3. Find the user document under `users/{uid}`
4. Add field: `role` with value `"admin"`
5. Save and refresh the app

## 💳 Razorpay Integration

### Configuration
Razorpay credentials are configured in `/app/src/config/razorpayConfig.js`:
- Key ID: `rzp_test_RVeELbQdxuBBiv`
- Key Secret: `CtWqj2m5dczsvq3fWC9CJvYO`

### Payment Flow (Web Platform)
1. User adds items to cart
2. Proceeds to checkout and enters shipping address
3. Clicks "Place Order & Pay"
4. Razorpay order is created (mock on client-side)
5. Razorpay Checkout modal opens
6. User completes payment
7. Payment signature is verified (mock verification)
8. Order status updated to "paid"
9. Product stock reduced
10. Cart cleared
11. User redirected to order history

### Mobile Platform Note
Native mobile Razorpay integration requires the `react-native-razorpay` package. For now:
- Orders are created with "pending" payment status
- Future: Implement proper native Razorpay integration

### Production Deployment
⚠️ **Important for Production:**
- Payment verification MUST be done server-side using Firebase Cloud Functions
- Current implementation uses mock verification for testing
- See `/app/src/services/razorpayService.js` for production notes
